## 🎪 **Demo Script Recommendations**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
*"RareSift transforms how AV teams search their driving data. Instead of manually reviewing hours of footage, teams can now ask questions in natural language and get precise results instantly."*

### **Live Demo (2 minutes)**
1. **Show Problem**: *"Traditional video search requires manual tagging and keyword matching"*
2. **Demonstrate Solution**: Search for "pedestrians crossing street" 
3. **Highlight Intelligence**: Show semantic understanding vs keyword matching
4. **Show Video Playback**: Click result, video opens at exact timestamp
5. **Export Feature**: Select multiple results, export as training dataset

### **Technical Deep Dive (1 minute)**
*"Under the hood, we're using OpenAI's CLIP model to understand both text and visual content. Every second of video gets a 512-dimensional embedding that captures semantic meaning. This enables searches like 'cars turning in heavy rain' to work perfectly."*

### **Market Opportunity (30 seconds)**
*"AV companies are drowning in video data - millions of hours of footage with no way to efficiently find specific scenarios for model training and testing. We've built the first AI-native solution for this $10B+ market."*
