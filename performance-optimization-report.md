# RareSift Performance Optimization Report\nGenerated on: 2025-07-31 01:59:54\n\n## Performance Recommendations\n1. Consider using joinedload() in auth.py to prevent N+1 queries\n2. Consider using joinedload() in export.py to prevent N+1 queries\n3. Consider using joinedload() in search.py to prevent N+1 queries\n4. Consider using joinedload() in videos.py to prevent N+1 queries\n5. Copy dependency files first in Dockerfile.prod for better caching\n6. Consider adding asyncpg: Use asyncpg for better PostgreSQL async performance\n7. Consider adding uvloop: Use uvloop for faster event loop\n8. Consider adding orjson: Use orjson for faster JSON serialization\n\n## Performance Optimization Checklist\n   ✅ Database indexes for frequently queried fields\n   ✅ Redis caching for search results and metadata\n   ✅ Connection pooling for database connections\n   ✅ Async/await patterns for I/O operations\n   ✅ Gzip compression for HTTP responses\n   ✅ Static asset optimization and CDN\n   ✅ Docker image optimization with multi-stage builds\n   ✅ Performance monitoring middleware\n   ✅ Rate limiting to prevent abuse\n   ✅ Proper error handling and logging\n\n## Next Steps\n1. Run performance tests to establish baseline metrics\n2. Implement recommended optimizations\n3. Re-run performance tests to measure improvements\n4. Monitor production performance continuously\n5. Set up alerts for performance degradation
