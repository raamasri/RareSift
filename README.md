# RareSift - AI-Driven AV Scenario Search Engine

> **Demo Build for YC Application** - Fast-track MVP optimized for autonomous vehicle scenario discovery

RareSift is a SAAS product that provides AI-driven search capabilities for driving scenarios and edge cases in autonomous vehicle (AV) datasets. Teams can quickly find specific scenarios using natural language queries or example clips, dramatically reducing the time spent manually searching through hours of driving footage.

## üéØ Key Value Proposition

**Problem**: AV teams waste hours manually searching through millions of miles of recorded driving data to find edge cases and specific scenarios for testing and training.

**Solution**: AI-powered semantic search that lets you find scenarios in seconds using natural language queries like "pedestrian crossing at night" or by uploading example clips.

**ROI**: Reduce scenario discovery time from hours to minutes, enabling faster model iteration and better edge case coverage.

4. Select results and export as a dataset

## üìä Demo Script for YC

### The Problem (30 seconds)
"AV teams at companies like Waymo and Cruise have millions of miles of driving footage, but finding specific edge cases takes hours of manual work. A single engineer might spend a full day looking for 'rainy night pedestrian crossings' across their dataset."

### The Solution (45 seconds)
"RareSift lets you search driving videos like Google searches text. Type 'pedestrian crossing at night' and get results in seconds, not hours. Upload an example clip and find similar scenarios instantly."

**[Live Demo]**
1. Upload 5-minute sample video ‚Üí Processing starts
2. Search "pedestrian near intersection" ‚Üí Show 10 results in <2 seconds
3. Select 3 scenarios ‚Üí Export as training dataset
4. Download ZIP with frames + metadata

### The Market (30 seconds)  
"Every AV company needs this. There are 100+ companies working on autonomous vehicles, each with data teams that spend 20-40% of their time on scenario discovery. We're building the picks-and-shovels tool that makes every AV team more productive."

### Traction & Ask (15 seconds)
"Built this MVP in 6 weeks. Ready to pilot with 3 AV companies already interested. Seeking $500K to hire 2 engineers and land our first 10 customers."

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Video Processing Stuck**
```bash
# Check backend logs
docker-compose logs backend

# Restart processing service
docker-compose restart backend
```

**Search Returns No Results**
- Ensure videos are fully processed (check video library)
- Try broader search terms
- Lower similarity threshold in advanced filters

**CLIP Model Loading Fails**
- Requires 4GB+ RAM
- Check PyTorch/CUDA compatibility
- Use CPU-only mode if needed

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Monitor resource usage
docker stats

# Scale backend for heavy processing
docker-compose up --scale backend=2
```
