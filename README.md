# RareSift - AI-Driven AV Scenario Search Engine

> **Demo Build for YC Application** - Fast-track MVP optimized for autonomous vehicle scenario discovery

RareSift is a SAAS product that provides AI-driven search capabilities for driving scenarios and edge cases in autonomous vehicle (AV) datasets. Teams can quickly find specific scenarios using natural language queries or example clips, dramatically reducing the time spent manually searching through hours of driving footage.

## üéØ Key Value Proposition

**Problem**: AV teams waste hours manually searching through millions of miles of recorded driving data to find edge cases and specific scenarios for testing and training.

**Solution**: AI-powered semantic search that lets you find scenarios in seconds using natural language queries like "pedestrian crossing at night" or by uploading example clips.

**ROI**: Reduce scenario discovery time from hours to minutes, enabling faster model iteration and better edge case coverage.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- Processing status tracking with real-time updates

‚úÖ **Natural Language Search**
- Search using natural language queries
- Example: "pedestrian near intersection at night"
- AI-powered similarity matching with confidence scores
- Advanced filtering by time, weather, speed, etc.

‚úÖ **Image-Based Search**
- Upload example images to find similar scenarios
- Visual similarity matching using CLIP embeddings
- Perfect for finding variations of known edge cases

‚úÖ **Export & Download**

### The Solution (45 seconds)
"RareSift lets you search driving videos like Google searches text. Type 'pedestrian crossing at night' and get results in seconds, not hours. Upload an example clip and find similar scenarios instantly."

**[Live Demo]**
1. Upload 5-minute sample video ‚Üí Processing starts
2. Search "pedestrian near intersection" ‚Üí Show 10 results in <2 seconds
3. Select 3 scenarios ‚Üí Export as training dataset
4. Download ZIP with frames + metadata

### The Market (30 seconds)  
"Every AV company needs this. There are 100+ companies working on autonomous vehicles, each with data teams that spend 20-40% of their time on scenario discovery. We're building the picks-and-shovels tool that makes every AV team more productive."

### Traction & Ask (15 seconds)
"Built this MVP in 6 weeks. Ready to pilot with 3 AV companies already interested. Seeking $500K to hire 2 engineers and land our first 10 customers."

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Video Processing Stuck**
```bash
# Check backend logs
docker-compose logs backend

# Restart processing service
docker-compose restart backend
```

**Search Returns No Results**
- Ensure videos are fully processed (check video library)
- Try broader search terms
- Lower similarity threshold in advanced filters

**CLIP Model Loading Fails**
- Requires 4GB+ RAM
- Check PyTorch/CUDA compatibility
- Use CPU-only mode if needed

### Performance Optimization

#### Automated Performance Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive performance tests
python3 scripts/performance-test-suite.py

# Quick performance check
python3 scripts/performance-test-suite.py --quick

# Load test with custom parameters
python3 scripts/performance-test-suite.py --url=https://your-domain.com
```

#### Performance Optimization Tools
```bash
# Analyze and optimize performance
python3 scripts/performance-optimization.py

# Optimize database queries and indexes
python3 scripts/optimize-database.py

# Production cleanup (remove debug code)
python3 scripts/production-cleanup.py --live --clean-temp
```

#### Scaling for High Load
```bash
# Monitor resource usage
docker stats

# Scale backend services
docker-compose up --scale backend=3 --scale worker=2

# Enable Redis caching for faster responses
# (automatically configured in production setup)
```

#### Performance Benchmarks
- **Search Latency**: <500ms average (with caching)
- **Concurrent Users**: 100+ simultaneous users supported
- **Video Processing**: 2-5 videos/minute (depending on length)
- **Database Queries**: <100ms average response time
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >80% for frequent searches
